      <description>I have noticed that sometimes the BT&amp;rsquo;s DNS servers go down due to this i have done some hunting around and found some backup servers which you can use.
nameserver 194.72.9.38 # ns8.bt.net nameserver 194.74.65.69 # ns7.bt.net nameserver 194.72.9.34 # ns5.bt.net nameserver 194.74.65.68 # ns6.bt.net nameserver 194.72.0.98 # indnsc60.ukcore.bt.net nameserver 194.72.0.114 # indnsc61.ukcore.bt.net nameserver 62.6.40.162 # indnsc70.ukcore.bt.net nameserver 62.6.40.178 # indnsc71.ukcore.bt.net </description>

      <description>I cant find the URL where I found this tweak but it is a very useful one to do.Â There is a config setting called **browser.cache.disk.capacity **within firefox if you drop the value down from 50000 to 15000 this speeds up the load time and you should also find that firefox should be a little more friendly on the system memory.
FYI, if your not sure how to find the config settings open up firefox and then browse to the following &amp;lsquo;about:config&amp;rsquo; minus the quotes.</description>
