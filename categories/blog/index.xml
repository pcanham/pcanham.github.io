      <description>I have been working on a migration project and one thing i have seen a couple of times is people love to over engineer solutions when basic troubleshooting and debugging would have found the problem.
One example of this was an engineer was migrating a java based application shared with the testers the URL saying ready for smoke testing. The URL was slightly different to what the tester was expecting, it ended in 8080 e.</description>

      <description>Nearly a new year, but a new blog engine, why would you ask and the honest answer would be to play with some new technology but also to find away to reduce costs and free up my time from having to constantly patch a wordpress site.</description>

      <description>We called it the Rubber Duck method of debugging. It goes like this:
1) Beg, borrow, steal, buy, fabricate or otherwise obtain a rubber duck (bathtub variety) 2) Place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over some code with it, if that&#39;s all right. 3) Explain to the duck what you code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain things line by line 4) At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and then realise that that is not in fact what you are actually doing.</description>
