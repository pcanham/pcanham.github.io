      <description>We called it the Rubber Duck method of debugging. It goes like this:
1) Beg, borrow, steal, buy, fabricate or otherwise obtain a rubber duck (bathtub variety) 2) Place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over some code with it, if that&#39;s all right. 3) Explain to the duck what you code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain things line by line 4) At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and then realise that that is not in fact what you are actually doing.</description>

      <description>Two commands which you need to run. #openssl rsa -noout -text -in www.domainname.com.key #openssl req -noout -text -in www.domainname.com.csr #openssl x509 -noout -text -in www.domainname.com.crt Check for modulus part in the output of both commands
If the modulus output match, then your .crt and .key files are matching.</description>

      <description>I have noticed that sometimes the BT&amp;rsquo;s DNS servers go down due to this i have done some hunting around and found some backup servers which you can use.
nameserver 194.72.9.38 # ns8.bt.net nameserver 194.74.65.69 # ns7.bt.net nameserver 194.72.9.34 # ns5.bt.net nameserver 194.74.65.68 # ns6.bt.net nameserver 194.72.0.98 # indnsc60.ukcore.bt.net nameserver 194.72.0.114 # indnsc61.ukcore.bt.net nameserver 62.6.40.162 # indnsc70.ukcore.bt.net nameserver 62.6.40.178 # indnsc71.ukcore.bt.net </description>

      <title>Speeding up the firefox loading process</title>

      <description>I cant find the URL where I found this tweak but it is a very useful one to do.Â There is a config setting called **browser.cache.disk.capacity **within firefox if you drop the value down from 50000 to 15000 this speeds up the load time and you should also find that firefox should be a little more friendly on the system memory.
FYI, if your not sure how to find the config settings open up firefox and then browse to the following &amp;lsquo;about:config&amp;rsquo; minus the quotes.</description>
